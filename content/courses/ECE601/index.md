This is a graduate-level course on linear dynamical systems with an emphasis on state-space modeling in both discrete and continuous time. Topics covered include equilibrium points and linearization, natural and forced responses, canonical forms and transformations, controllability and observability, and control-theoretic concepts such as pole placement, stabilization, dynamic compensation, and the separation principle. The material in this course is fundamental knowledge for students pursuing research in systems/control theory, signal processing, or mechanical/electrical/industrial engineering.
