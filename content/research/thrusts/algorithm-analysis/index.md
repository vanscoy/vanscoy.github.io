Optimization is a powerful mathematical framework for modeling a multitude of problems throughout science and engineering. By interpreting optimization algorithms as dynamical systems, we use tools from robust control to systematically analyze the performance of optimization algorithms, and we design novel algorithms that have strong theoretical guarantees in a variety of scenarios.
