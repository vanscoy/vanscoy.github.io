Groups of robots can coordinate with each other to solve complex problems that are difficult or impossible for each robot to solve individually. Swarms of flying robots, for example, can explore and map unknown environments, and smart cars can communicate with each other to strategically plan routes and minimize travel times. We study multiple-agent algorithms for a variety of tasks such as distributed optimization and dynamic average consensus.
