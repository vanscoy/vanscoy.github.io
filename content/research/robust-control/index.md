Practical systems often contain components that are uncertain, noisy, and/or nonlinear. Examples include saturation and friction in physical systems, fluctuations in wind and solar renewable energy sources in the smart grid, and activation functions in a neural network. Using integral quadratic constraints from robust control, we have developed a systematic characterization of the rate of convergence of such systems, and we used semidefinite programming duality to construct the most destabilizing problem instances.
