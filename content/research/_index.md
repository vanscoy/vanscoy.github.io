Computers use algorithms to solve problems and make decisions, from back-flipping robots and self-driving cars to massive robotic swarms. Such algorithms are studied in the fields of optimization and control: the former seeks to find the best single decision based on an objective and constraints, while the latter studies multiple decisions made sequentially over time. Moreover, these algorithms are often used in robotics, where robots must use sensors to decide how to interact with the physical world. My research studies algorithms in optimization and control with applications in robotics.
