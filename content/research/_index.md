Computers use algorithms to solve problems and make decisions, from back-flipping robots and self-driving cars to massive robotic swarms. Such algorithms are studied in the fields of optimization and control: the former seeks to find the best single decision based on an objective and constraints, while the latter studies multiple decisions made sequentially over time. My research studies algorithms in optimization and control with applications in robotics. Below is a summary of my main research thrusts with links to my most relevant publications.
